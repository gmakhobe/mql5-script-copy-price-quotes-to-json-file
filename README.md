# Mql5 Script
Function of this script is to copy a range of price quotes of any symbol to a json file. I have used MQl5 C++ like language to write the script!
 
Output results is as follows:
```
{
  {
     "Symbol": "USDJPY",
     "Open": 103.121,
     "Close": 103.199,
     "high": 103.256,
     "low": 103.073,
     "time": "2021.01.04 00:00:00"
  },
  {
     "Symbol": "USDJPY",
     "Open": 103.201,
     "Close": 103.246,
     "high": 103.316,
     "low": 103.199,
